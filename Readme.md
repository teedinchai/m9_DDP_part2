## Coursera Module 9 - Developing Data Products -  Part 2 - Pitch Presentation
This repository has the files for the second part of the Developing Data Products Course Project. 

In the first part of the assignment, a shiny application titled "Light Guiding for Optical Communication" has been created and deployed it on Rstudio's servers. In the Second part, Slidify is used to create a 5 pages pitch presentation about the application.

The shiny app developed for the assignment is avalilable at:
<https://dctee.shinyapps.io/project>

Source code for ui.R and server.R files are available on the GitHub:

The title for this shiny application is **"Light Guiding for Optical Communication"**. The function of this application is to calculate the refractive index versus wavelength for four popular optical materials (Silica, Silicon, Gallium Arsenide and ZBALN). Besides that, it also calculate the critical angle for total internal reflection, velocity of light in the transmission medium, reflectivity and transmission coefficient for normal incident light.  

There is no dataset needed to be loaded for this application. This application get input from user and based on the input, the application calculate the output by solving some equations.
